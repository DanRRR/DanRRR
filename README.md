# Dan Ruksujarit | Quantitative Researcher in Training

I am a quantitative finance student with background in computer science, machine learning, and statistical modelling, with a growing focus on **systematic trading, alpha research, and market microstructure**.

My core interest are in **integrating stochastic modelling, econometrics, and machine learning** into coherent research pipelines.

## 🧠 Research & Projects

### 🔹 Alpha Research Pipeline
- End-to-end alpha research workflow:
  - Idea generation → expression templating → simulation → filtering → storage
- Custom simulation orchestration using WorldQuant BRAIN API
- Correlation-aware retry logic and performance-based ranking
- Local database ingestion for research-scale experimentation

### 🔹 Market Prediction & ML
- Deep learning models applied to financial time-series and limit order book data
- Comparative analysis: linear models vs deep sequence models
- Focus on **when ML adds signal**, not just whether it can fit data

### 🔹 System Design
- FastAPI backends for research tooling
- Async pipelines, logging, reproducibility
- Dockerised development environments
